This will increase the guarantee of its achievement and help to understand progress.\n\n    - Measurable: the goal should contain a quantitative or qualitative indicator for measuring the implementation process.\n\n    - Achievable: the goal must be achievable, otherwise its probability execution will tend to zero.\n\n    - Relevant: the goal must be useful after it is achieved, otherwise it will be a wasted time.\n\n    - Time bound (Time bound): the term must be determined , the excess of which indicates its failure. This will motivate you to achieve it and not stretch the process indefinitely.\n\n\nThe following are examples of goals for SMART:\n\n    - Read the book 'Ulisses' till the end of the month\n\n    - Save $20 to buy a pan until the next week\n\n    - Start setting goals for SMART right now";
